# Restaurant Roulette
## What is it
Restaurant Roulette is a web application where you can get a random place to eat depending on location.

## Technology Stack
I used Python Flask for the backend and React for the frontend.

## Running the project
To run the project on your own you will need your own google places API.
Create a file called "key.py" in the folder named "backend". 
key.py should have a line that says, key = "This is where you copy your key"
